While I will have a Garmin GPS unit running, I do like having a manual backup - just in case.  I also like having a map so I can spend an hour the night before reviewing the route and perhaps looking for side roads to adventure.  The beauty of this retirement road trip is that if I see a road leading off into some unknown distant hills, I am free to go.  Trying to get a feel for the terrain ahead or where interesting waypoints along the way on a tiny GPS is impossible.  Having an actual map makes it so easy to look for alternate roads, forest service roads in the mountains, and possible stops.\\n\\nNow that I'm home, my Atlas &amp; Gazeteers are full of circles, scribbles, notes, and arrows.  They got a lot of use.  Even sitting at a rest stop, quite often other travelers would come up and ask me for directions to some place they're looking for.\\n\\nThe only downside to these maps?  Small print and I have old eyes.  I brought along a magnifying glass to read it better.  My bad luck to forget it at a rest stop and not realize it until I was 700+ miles away.  I stopped at a Walmart and bought another.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Fully Honest Review; I was not paid or given free product. Though I wish it was free after the hassle. Since this bag is listed as \"currently unavailable\" I'm going to leave my review in 2 different spots to warn people about the product. A large amount of this review will pertain to any arctic monsoon bag, I bought the Winter 5 degree bag . For sizing and comfort comparisons, I'm 5'10, lean 170lbs\\nCONs: As many others have mentioned, the pull strings break from inside the sleeves on both the hood and chest strings. So hopefully you have a needle and thread handy or you read this and reinforce the pull strings before you leave for a trip. I always carry a small sewing kit for emergencies *see picture of my knotted sewing mess with red string* 2nd: NO ONE LIKES COLD FEET! The loss of down fill over time and the down shifting inside the baffles should be expected, but after 2-3 weeks of use (14-21 nights) this bag had cold spots all over the place on the bottom side, most notably, the foot box. The down-fill thinned out or displaced to such an extreme that you can almost see through the bag. The only thing between you and the elements is two layers of nylon. Be prepared with wool socks!  3rd, the comfort rating of 5 degrees fahrenheit is a joke. I tend to run hot during the night and had a really hard time keeping warm inside this bag at 15 degrees after putting on a thermal layer. (most backpackers will tell you to sleep naked or in your underwear. Not possible here) Comfort rating would be closer to the 20degree mark. Hopefully the bag will be warmer when I tear this thing apart and stuff more down into the baffles.\\nPROs: Budget friendly at the Amazon.com price of $150 (last listing I saw was $120-130 marked down from $250). It's a great sleeping bag at a great price for beginners who will likely only spend a few nights a year under the stars and who will probably avoid temperatures lower than 32 Fahrenheit. Plenty of room at 5'10\" 170lbs. I'd venture to guess that someone that's 6'-6'2\" and up to 220lbs would be fine comfortable in the regular size.</td>\n",

One of the first things I do when planing a road trip to an unfamiliar area is purchase the map of the state.  I like & use GPS but there are times when it doesn't work AND it has been known to \"lie\".  In addition, GPS does not allow one to see the \"big picture\" like a map does.   \n",

I would be driving thru at least 6 states and wanted to have a hard map on hand for planning purposes.  While I will have a Garmin GPS unit running, I do like having a manual backup - just in case.  I also like having a map so I can spend an hour the night before reviewing the route and perhaps looking for side roads to adventure.  The beauty of this retirement road trip is that if I see a road leading off into some unknown distant hills, I am free to go.  Trying to get a feel for the terrain ahead or where interesting waypoints along the way on a tiny GPS is impossible.  Having an actual map makes it so easy to look for alternate roads, forest service roads in the mountains, and possible stops.\\n\\nNow that I'm home, my Atlas & Gazeteers are full of circles, scribbles, notes, and arrows.  They got a lot of use.  Even sitting at a rest stop, quite often other travelers would come up and ask me for directions to some place they're looking for.\\n\\nThe only downside to these maps?  Small print and I have old eyes.  I brought along a magnifying glass to read it better.  My bad luck to forget it at a rest stop and not realize it until I was 700+ miles away.  I stopped at a Walmart and bought another.   \n",

       "2839805  Fully Honest Review; I was not paid or given free product. Though I wish it was free after the hassle. Since this bag is listed as \"currently unavailable\" I'm going to leave my review in 2 different spots to warn people about the product. A large amount of this review will pertain to any arctic monsoon bag, I bought the Winter 5 degree bag . For sizing and comfort comparisons, I'm 5'10, lean 170lbs\\nCONs: As many others have mentioned, the pull strings break from inside the sleeves on both the hood and chest strings. So hopefully you have a needle and thread handy or you read this and reinforce the pull strings before you leave for a trip. I always carry a small sewing kit for emergencies *see picture of my knotted sewing mess with red string* 2nd: NO ONE LIKES COLD FEET! The loss of down fill over time and the down shifting inside the baffles should be expected, but after 2-3 weeks of use (14-21 nights) this bag had cold spots all over the place on the bottom side, most notably, the foot box. The down-fill thinned out or displaced to such an extreme that you can almost see through the bag. The only thing between you and the elements is two layers of nylon. Be prepared with wool socks!  3rd, the comfort rating of 5 degrees fahrenheit is a joke. I tend to run hot during the night and had a really hard time keeping warm inside this bag at 15 degrees after putting on a thermal layer. (most backpackers will tell you to sleep naked or in your underwear. Not possible here) Comfort rating would be closer to the 20degree mark. Hopefully the bag will be warmer when I tear this thing apart and stuff more down into the baffles.\\nPROs: Budget friendly at the Amazon.com price of $150 (last listing I saw was $120-130 marked down from $250). It's a great sleeping bag at a great price for beginners who will likely only spend a few nights a year under the stars and who will probably avoid temperatures lower than 32 Fahrenheit. Plenty of room at 5'10\" 170lbs. I'd venture to guess that someone that's 6'-6'2\" and up to 220lbs would be fine comfortable in the regular size.   \n",

Real carbon fiber, not some cheap laminate or coating over plastic.  Extremely light weight, and very secure holding a Camelbak bottle.  Worth every penny IMO.  Equivalents at bike shops are 50 and 60 dollars, with name brands like Specialized.   \n",

No wiggling or movement while riding from bottles so far, yet bottles come out easily for drinking.  Looks fantastic - better than a $50 Elite cage I purchased.  That cage is going back and I am ordering another one of these. Cant be beat on price.   \n",
